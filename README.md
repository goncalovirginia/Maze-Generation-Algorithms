# Maze Generation Algorithms

Open source JavaScript implementations of common Maze Generation Algorithms.

Every algorithm outputs a 2D array (matrix) forming the shape of the maze with either 0's (walls) and 1's (paths). 
Both the number of **rows** and **columns** should be **odd** for the desired result.
